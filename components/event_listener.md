## EventListener

The `EventListener` component makes it possible to listen to (arbitrary) JavaScript events. Simply wrap the relevant component(s) in an `EventListener` component, specify which event(s) to subscribe to, and what event properties to send back to Dash,

.. dash-proxy:: components.event_listener

If you are not sure what properties are available/what properties you need, you can pass `logging=True` to the `EventListener` component to print the event object tree to the JavaScript console. For the example above, the Chrome developer console output would be,

Note that if the relevant events are already exposed as properties in Dash, there is no benefit of using the `EventListener` component. The intended usage of the `EventListener` component is when this is _not_ the case. Say that you need to listen to double-click events, but the Dash component only exposes a (single) click property; or some data that you need is not propagated from the JavaScript layer. In these cases, the `EventListener` component makes it possible to achieve the desired behaviour without editing the component source code.
